/*

Now we finally arrive to the mighty join -operation, a backbone of modern
society. Without the join-operation, the world would surely be a whole lot more
primitive.

The join operation joins two tables together to produce a combined output by placing the columns of the
right table after the columns of the left table (unless we specify a different order in the select statement).
How the rows are combined depends on the type of join and the join-condition.

Lets start with the most simplest of join types, the cross join, also called the cartesian
product. This type simply takes all rows in the right table and combines each one with 
all the rows in the left table, to produce all possible row combinations across the
two tables.

Write a query that "selects star" from a the 'carriers' table and cross joins it
with the 'aircraft' table.
