/*

Subqueries are a powerful way to filter data based on results from another query.
They can be used in the WHERE clause to create dynamic filtering conditions.

Write a query that finds all flights operated by carriers whose names contain the 
word "Airlines" (case insensitive). 

Your query should return:
- The flight_num
- The carrier code
- The full carrier name (from the carriers table)
- The origin and destination airport codes
- The departure time (dep_time)

Order the results by carrier name alphabetically, then by departure time.

Hint: You'll need to use a subquery in the WHERE clause or a JOIN operation.
