So, let's also have a look at Null values.

As mentioned in exercise where_02, Null is different from True and False and
also require their own handling when filtering for them in our data. Null values
are filtered by using the "IS" operator (or "IS NOT" for the opposite), which
sounds logically similar to the equal sign (=) but is fundamentally different.

Write a query that selects all columns from the airports table where faa_region
is null.
