/*

Sometimes we might want to filter on multiple columns and make use of more
complex boolean expressions.

Fortunately, we can make use of the logical operators 'AND', 'OR' and 'NOT'.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when working with logical
operators. First, make sure that you understand the execution order of the
expression, especially when combining 'AND' and 'OR' statements. Secondly, be
aware that an expression might not only be True or False, it might also be Null!
How funny! You can make use of parenthesis to guide the database in which order
the logical expressions should be evaluated.

Write a query using the airport-table that selects all columns where 'fac_type'
is either 'HELIPORT' or 'SEAPLANE BASE' and elevation is larger than 10.
