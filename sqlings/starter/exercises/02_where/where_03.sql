/*

A common pattern when filtering text data, is to use the LIKE operator. The LIKE
operator allows you to use a wildcard (%) that represents any character, which
means that we don't need to write multiple AND statements for every exact text
match we want, but instead we can match for part of the string and then let the
rest of the string be anything.

Let's select columns from the airports table where the 'city' column also
have the word 'city' in it's name. Remember to pay attention to lower/upper
casing.
