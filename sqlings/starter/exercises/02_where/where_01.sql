Good job finishing all the select exercises! Well done! Now, lets have a look at
filtering.

Filtering is another core concept of working with data. In SQL, the universal
keyword for filtering is WHERE, followed by an expression that is evaluated for
each row and results in either True (row is included in result) or False (row is
    not included in result). A special case is Null values, that require their
special keyword IS in logical expressions, but more on Null-values later.

Write a query that selects all rows and columns from the airports table WHERE
elevation is larger than 1000.

select null;
