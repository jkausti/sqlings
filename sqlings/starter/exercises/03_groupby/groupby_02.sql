Let's continue where we left off. We are now interested in how many times each
possible route is flown, so for each combination of origin and destination.

Create a query that counts how many times each unique combination of origin and
destination occurs in the flights table. The output should have 3 columns,
'origin', 'destination' and 'count_route'.
