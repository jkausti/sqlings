/*

The next core concept is GROUP BY which lets us calculate aggregates based on
groups that we have in our data. We can for example use group by to calculate
how many occurrences we have of a certain value in a column.

For this section we will focus on the "flights" table. Lets try to find out how
many outbound flights every airport has.

Create a query that counts how many rows there are in the flights table for
each unique instance of the airport code in the "origin" column. The output
should have 2 columns named "origin" and "count_origin".
