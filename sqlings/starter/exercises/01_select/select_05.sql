Lets continue selecting things!

One thing that is always interesting about the data we have, is to know HOW MUCH
of it we have. We could of course use "select *" and manually count the rows in
the ouput, but that would take a long time and most editors limit the amount of
rows that we actually see when we select everything. Luckily, there is a way for
us to count all rows with SQL and just output the result.

Write a select statement that outputs the amount of rows we have in the aircraft
table.
