/*

As with many things in life, there is not always only one correct way of doing
things. The same applies to SQL!

We are now getting into things that will not necessarily have a single correct
solution, and the syntax might even differ depending on which database you are
working with.

Lets select every column from the aircraft table EXCEPT address2.

HINT: In DuckDb there is a way to avoid explicitly listing all columns that we
want, try to use that to save some typing!
