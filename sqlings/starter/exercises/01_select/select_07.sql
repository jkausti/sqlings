/*

In real world situations, at least when doing analytics, SQL queries have a
habit of becoming quite large. Being able to express what you want to do in a
shorter way saves you typing time and usually improves readability, which your
colleagues will be happy about!

Next, we want to select all columns from the aircraft table. However, we are not
happy about the cities being all uppercase. It sounds like someone is SHOUTING
the city names at us!

Write a query that selects all columns, but REPLACES the data in the city column
with lowercase city names.

Hint: Like the previous exercise, there are multiple ways of achieving this. The
cleaner way of doing it is by using a DuckDB-specific text function. So you
might want to dive into the DuckDB documentation to find it unless you happen to
know it by heart. Reading documentation is after all a core skill, since no one
can remember every little function and keyword, nor is it a good use of
your brain capacity to memorize it. But if you know how to read documentation,
you basically already know everything, right?
