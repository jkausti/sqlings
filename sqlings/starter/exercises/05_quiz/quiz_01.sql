/*

If you have made it this far, you already know about the most fundamental SQL
operations that you need to be able to work with data.

Now let's put these skills to test in a QUIZ!

We want to find which carriers uses which aircraft model and how much.

Write a query that selects the 'name' column from the carriers table, the
'manufacturer' and the 'model' columns from the aircraft_models table and
lastly creates a 'count_flights' column that counts how many flights each
carrier has with each aircraft model. And we don't want to include cancelled
flights in our calcuation!

Good luck!
